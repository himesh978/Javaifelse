# Java If Else
The if statement alone tells us that if a condition is true it will execute a block of statements and if the condition is false it wonâ€™t. But what if we want to do something else if the condition is false. Here comes the else statement. We can use the else statement with if statement to execute a block of code when the condition is false.
Working of if-else statements;
Control falls into the if block.
The flow jumps to Condition.
Condition is tested.
 If Condition yields true, goto Step 4.
 If Condition yields false, goto Step 5.
The if-block or the body inside the if is executed.
The else block or the body inside the else is executed.
Flow exits the if-else block.
